## Synopsis

| **mount.ceph** *name*@\*fsid\*.\*fs_name\*=/\[*subdir*\] *dir* \[-o
  *options* \]

## Description

**mount.ceph** is a helper for mounting the Ceph file system on a Linux
host. It serves to resolve monitor hostname(s) into IP addresses and
read authentication keys from disk; the Linux kernel client component
does most of the real work. To mount a Ceph file system use:

    mount.ceph name@07fe3187-00d9-42a3-814b-72a4d5e7d5be.fs_name=/ /mnt/mycephfs -o mon_addr=1.2.3.4

where \"name\" is the RADOS client name (referred to hereafter as
\"RADOS user\", and meaning any individual or system actor such as an
application).

Mount helper can fill in the cluster FSID by reading the ceph
configuration file. Its recommended to call the mount helper via
mount(8) as per:

    mount -t ceph name@.fs_name=/ /mnt/mycephfs -o mon_addr=1.2.3.4

Note that the dot `.` still needs to be a part of the device string in
this case.

The first argument is the device part of the mount command. It includes
the RADOS user for authentication, the file system name and a path
within CephFS that will be mounted at the mount point.

Monitor addresses can be passed using `mon_addr` mount option. Multiple
monitor addresses can be passed by separating addresses with a slash
([/]{.title-ref}). Only one monitor is needed to mount successfully; the
client will learn about all monitors from any responsive monitor.
However, it is a good idea to specify more than one in case the one
happens to be down at the time of mount. Monitor addresses takes the
form ip_address\[:port\]. If the port is not specified, the Ceph default
of 6789 is assumed.

If monitor addresses are not specified, then **mount.ceph** will attempt
to determine monitor addresses using local configuration files and/or
DNS SRV records. In similar way, if authentication is enabled on Ceph
cluster (which is done using CephX) and options `secret` and
`secretfile` are not specified in the command, the mount helper will
spawn a child process that will use the standard Ceph library routines
to find a keyring and fetch the secret from it (including the monitor
address and FSID if those not specified).

A sub-directory of the file system can be mounted by specifying the
(absolute) path to the sub-directory right after \"=\" in the device
part of the mount command.

Mount helper application conventions dictate that the first two options
are device to be mounted and the mount point for that device. Options
must be passed only after these fixed arguments.

## Options

### Basic

`conf`{.interpreted-text role="command"}

:   Path to a ceph.conf file. This is used to initialize the Ceph
    context for autodiscovery of monitor addresses and auth secrets. The
    default is to use the standard search path for ceph.conf files.

`mount_timeout`{.interpreted-text role="command"}

:   int (seconds), Default: 60

`ms_mode=<legacy|crc|secure|prefer-crc|prefer-secure>`{.interpreted-text role="command"}

:   Set the connection mode that the client uses for transport. The
    available modes are:

    -   `legacy`: use messenger v1 protocol to talk to the cluster
    -   `crc`: use messenger v2, without on-the-wire encryption
    -   `secure`: use messenger v2, with on-the-wire encryption
    -   `prefer-crc`: crc mode, if denied agree to secure mode
    -   `prefer-secure`: secure mode, if denied agree to crc mode

`mon_addr`{.interpreted-text role="command"}

:   Monitor address of the cluster in the form of ip_address\[:port\]

`fsid`{.interpreted-text role="command"}

:   Cluster FSID. This can be found using [ceph fsid]{.title-ref}
    command.

`secret`{.interpreted-text role="command"}

:   secret key for use with CephX. This option is insecure because it
    exposes the secret on the command line. To avoid this, use the
    secretfile option.

`secretfile`{.interpreted-text role="command"}

:   path to file containing the secret key to use with CephX

`recover_session=<no|clean>`{.interpreted-text role="command"}

:   Set auto reconnect mode in the case where the client is blocklisted.
    The available modes are `no` and `clean`. The default is `no`.

    -   `no`: never attempt to reconnect when client detects that it has
        been blocklisted. Blocklisted clients will not attempt to
        reconnect and their operations will fail too.
    -   `clean`: client reconnects to the Ceph cluster automatically
        when it detects that it has been blocklisted. During reconnect,
        client drops dirty data/metadata, invalidates page caches and
        writable file handles. After reconnect, file locks become stale
        because the MDS loses track of them. If an inode contains any
        stale file locks, read/write on the inode is not allowed until
        applications release all stale file locks.

:command: [fs=\<fs-name\>]{.title-ref}

:   Specify the non-default file system to be mounted, when using the
    old syntax.

:command: [mds_namespace=\<fs-name\>]{.title-ref}

:   A synonym of \"fs=\" (Deprecated).

### Advanced

`cap_release_safety`{.interpreted-text role="command"}

:   int, Default: calculated

`caps_wanted_delay_max`{.interpreted-text role="command"}

:   int, cap release delay, Default: 60

`caps_wanted_delay_min`{.interpreted-text role="command"}

:   int, cap release delay, Default: 5

`dirstat`{.interpreted-text role="command"}

:   funky [cat dirname]{.title-ref} for stats, Default: off

`nodirstat`{.interpreted-text role="command"}

:   no funky [cat dirname]{.title-ref} for stats

`ip`{.interpreted-text role="command"}

:   my ip

`noasyncreaddir`{.interpreted-text role="command"}

:   no dcache readdir

`nocrc`{.interpreted-text role="command"}

:   no data crc on writes

`noshare`{.interpreted-text role="command"}

:   create a new client instance, instead of sharing an existing
    instance of a client mounting the same cluster

`osdkeepalive`{.interpreted-text role="command"}

:   int, Default: 5

`osd_idle_ttl`{.interpreted-text role="command"}

:   int (seconds), Default: 60

`rasize`{.interpreted-text role="command"}

:   int (bytes), max readahead. Default: 8388608 (8192\*1024)

`rbytes`{.interpreted-text role="command"}

:   Report the recursive size of the directory contents for st_size on
    directories. Default: off

`norbytes`{.interpreted-text role="command"}

:   Do not report the recursive size of the directory contents for
    st_size on directories.

`readdir_max_bytes`{.interpreted-text role="command"}

:   int, Default: 524288 (512\*1024)

`readdir_max_entries`{.interpreted-text role="command"}

:   int, Default: 1024

`rsize`{.interpreted-text role="command"}

:   int (bytes), max read size. Default: 16777216 (16\*1024\*1024)

`snapdirname`{.interpreted-text role="command"}

:   string, set the name of the hidden snapdir. Default: .snap

`write_congestion_kb`{.interpreted-text role="command"}

:   int (kb), max writeback in flight. scale with available memory.
    Default: calculated from available memory

`wsize`{.interpreted-text role="command"}

:   int (bytes), max write size. Default: 16777216 (16\*1024\*1024)
    (writeback uses smaller of wsize and stripe unit)

`wsync`{.interpreted-text role="command"}

:   Execute all namespace operations synchronously. This ensures that
    the namespace operation will only complete after receiving a reply
    from the MDS. This is the default.

`nowsync`{.interpreted-text role="command"}

:   Allow the client to do namespace operations asynchronously. When
    this option is enabled, a namespace operation may complete before
    the MDS replies, if it has sufficient capabilities to do so.

`crush_location=x`{.interpreted-text role="command"}

:   Specify the location of the client in terms of CRUSH hierarchy
    (since 5.8). This is a set of key-value pairs separated from each
    other by \'\' may need to be quoted or escaped to avoid it being
    interpreted as a pipe by the shell. The key is the bucket type name
    (e.g. rack, datacenter or region with default bucket types) and the
    value is the bucket name. For example, to indicate that the client
    is local to rack \"myrack\", data center \"mydc\" and region
    \"myregion\":

        crush_location=rack:myrack|datacenter:mydc|region:myregion

    Each key-value pair stands on its own: \"myrack\" doesn\'t need to
    reside in \"mydc\", which in turn doesn\'t need to reside in
    \"myregion\". The location is not a path to the root of the
    hierarchy but rather a set of nodes that are matched independently.
    \"Multipath\" locations are supported, so it is possible to indicate
    locality for multiple parallel hierarchies:

        crush_location=rack:myrack1|rack:myrack2|datacenter:mydc

`read_from_replica=<no|balance|localize>`{.interpreted-text role="command"}

:   -   `no`: Disable replica reads, always pick the primary OSD (since
        5.8, default).

    -   `balance`: When a replicated pool receives a read request, pick
        a random OSD from the PG\'s acting set to serve it (since 5.8).

        This mode is safe for general use only since Octopus (i.e. after
        \"ceph osd require-osd-release octopus\"). Otherwise it should
        be limited to read-only workloads such as snapshots.

    -   `localize`: When a replicated pool receives a read request, pick
        the most local OSD to serve it (since 5.8). The locality metric
        is calculated against the location of the client given with
        crush_location; a match with the lowest-valued bucket type wins.
        For example, an OSD in a matching rack is closer than an OSD in
        a matching data center, which in turn is closer than an OSD in a
        matching region.

        This mode is safe for general use only since Octopus (i.e. after
        \"ceph osd require-osd-release octopus\"). Otherwise it should
        be limited to read-only workloads such as snapshots.

## Examples

Mount the full file system:

    mount -t ceph fs_user@.mycephfs2=/ /mnt/mycephfs

Mount only part of the namespace/file system:

    mount.ceph fs_user@.mycephfs2=/some/directory/in/cephfs /mnt/mycephfs

Pass the monitor host\'s IP address, optionally:

    mount.ceph fs_user@.mycephfs2=/ /mnt/mycephfs -o mon_addr=192.168.0.1

Pass the port along with IP address if it\'s running on a non-standard
port:

    mount.ceph fs_user@.mycephfs2=/ /mnt/mycephfs -o mon_addr=192.168.0.1:7000

If there are multiple monitors, pass each address separated by a \`/\`:

    mount.ceph fs_user@.mycephfs2=/ /mnt/mycephfs -o mon_addr=192.168.0.1/192.168.0.2/192.168.0.3

Pass secret key for CephX user optionally:

    mount.ceph fs_user@.mycephfs2=/ /mnt/mycephfs -o secret=AQATSKdNGBnwLhAAnNDKnH65FmVKpXZJVasUeQ==

Pass file containing secret key to avoid leaving secret key in shell\'s
command history:

    mount.ceph fs_user@.mycephfs2=/ /mnt/mycephfs -o secretfile=/etc/ceph/fs_username.secret

If authentication is disabled on Ceph cluster, omit the credential
related option:

    mount.ceph fs_user@.mycephfs2=/ /mnt/mycephfs

To mount using the old syntax:

    mount -t ceph 192.168.0.1:/ /mnt/mycephfs

**mount.ceph** is part of Ceph, a massively scalable, open-source,
distributed storage system. Please refer to the Ceph documentation at
<https://docs.ceph.com> for more information.

## Feature Availability

The `recover_session=` option was added to mainline Linux kernels in
v5.4. `wsync` and `nowsync` were added in v5.7.
