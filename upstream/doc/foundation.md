# Ceph Foundation {#foundation}

The Ceph Foundation exists to enable industry members to collaborate and
pool resources to support the Ceph project community. The Foundation
provides an open, collaborative, and neutral home for project
stakeholders to coordinate their development and community investments
in the Ceph ecosystem.

The Ceph Foundation is organized as a directed fund under the Linux
Foundation. Premier and General Member organizations contribute a yearly
fee to become members. Associate members are educational institutions or
government organizations and are invited to join at no cost.
